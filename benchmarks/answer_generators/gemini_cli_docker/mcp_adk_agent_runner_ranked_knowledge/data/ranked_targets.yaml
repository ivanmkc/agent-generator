  docstring: "Base class for creating plugins.\n\nPlugins provide a structured way to intercept and modify agent, tool, and\nLLM behaviors at critical execution points in a callback manner. While agent\ncallbacks apply to a particular agent, plugins applies globally to all\nagents added in the runner. Plugins are best used for adding custom behaviors\nlike logging, monitoring, caching, or modifying requests and responses at key\nstages.\n\nA plugin can implement one or more methods of callbacks, but should not\nimplement the same method of callback for multiple times.\n\nRelation with [Agent callbacks](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/callbacks/):\n\n**Execution Order**\nSimilar to Agent callbacks, Plugins are executed in the order they are\nregistered. However, Plugin and Agent Callbacks are executed sequentially,\nwith Plugins takes precedence over agent callbacks. When the callback in a\nplugin returns a value, it will short circuit all remaining plugins and\nagent callbacks, causing\
    \ all remaining plugins and agent callbacks\nto be skipped.\n\n**Change Propagation**\nPlugins and agent callbacks can both modify the value of the input parameters,\nincluding agent input, tool input, and LLM request/response, etc. They work in\nthe exactly same way. The modifications will be visible and passed to the next\ncallback in the chain. For example, if a plugin modifies the tool input with\nbefore_tool_callback, the modified tool input will be passed to the\nbefore_tool_callback of the next plugin, and further passed to the agent\ncallbacks if not short circuited.\n\nTo use a plugin, implement the desired callback methods and pass an instance\nof your custom plugin class to the ADK Runner.\n\nExamples:\n    A simple plugin that logs every tool call.\n\n    >>> class ToolLoggerPlugin(BasePlugin):\n    ..   def __init__(self):\n    ..     super().__init__(name=\"tool_logger\")\n    ..\n    ..   async def before_tool_callback(\n    ..       self, *, tool: BaseTool, tool_args:\

  docstring: 'An LLM-based event summarizer for sliding window compaction.


    This class is responsible for summarizing a provided list of events into a

    single compacted event. It is designed to be used as part of a sliding window

    compaction process.


    The actual logic for determining *when* to trigger compaction and *which*

    events form the sliding window (based on parameters like

    `compaction_invocation_threshold` and `overlap_size` from

    `EventsCompactionConfig`) is handled by an external component, such as an ADK

    "Runner". This compactor focuses solely on generating a summary of the events

    it receives.


    When `maybe_compact_events` is called with a list of events, this class

    formats the events, generates a summary using an LLM, and returns a new

    `Event` containing the summary within an `EventCompaction`.

  docstring: "ADK Service Registry.\n\nThis module manages pluggable backend services for sessions, artifacts, and memory.\nADK includes built-in support for common backends like SQLite, PostgreSQL,\nGCS, and Vertex AI Agent Engine. You can also extend ADK by registering\ncustom services.\n\nThere are two ways to register custom services:\n\n1. YAML Configuration (Recommended for simple cases)\n   If your custom service can be instantiated with `MyService(uri=\"...\", **kwargs)`,\n   you can register it without writing Python code by creating a `services.yaml`\n   or `services.yml` file in your agent directory (e.g., `my_agent/services.yaml`).\n\n   Example `services.yaml`:\n   ```yaml\n   services:\n     - scheme: mysession\n       type: session\n       class: my_package.my_module.MyCustomSessionService\n     - scheme: mymemory\n       type: memory\n       class: my_package.other_module.MyCustomMemoryService\n   ```\n\n2. Python Registration (`services.py`)\n   For more complex initialization\
    \ logic, create a `services.py` file in your\n   agent directory (e.g., `my_agent/services.py`). In this file, get the\n   registry instance and register your custom factory functions. This file can\n   be used for registration in addition to, or instead of, `services.yaml`.\n\n   Example `services.py`:\n   ```python\n   from google.adk.cli.service_registry import get_service_registry\n   from my_package.my_module import MyCustomSessionService\n\n   def my_session_factory(uri: str, **kwargs):\n       # custom logic\n       return MyCustomSessionService(...)\n\n   get_service_registry().register_session_service(\"mysession\", my_session_factory)\n   ```\n\nNote: If both `services.yaml` (or `.yml`) and `services.py` are present in the\nsame directory, services from **both** files will be loaded. YAML files are\nprocessed first, then `services.py`. If the same service scheme is defined in\nboth, the definition in `services.py` will overwrite the one from YAML."

    This executor securely runs code by dynamically creating a Kubernetes Job for

    each execution request. The user''s code is mounted via a ConfigMap, and the

    Pod is hardened with a strict security context and resource limits.


    Key Features:

    - Sandboxed execution using the gVisor runtime.

    - Ephemeral, per-execution environments using Kubernetes Jobs.

    - Secure-by-default Pod configuration (non-root, no privileges).

    - Automatic garbage collection of completed Jobs and Pods via TTL.

    - Efficient, event-driven waiting using the Kubernetes watch API.


    RBAC Permissions:

    This executor requires a ServiceAccount with specific RBAC permissions. The

    Role granted to the ServiceAccount must include rules to manage Jobs,

    ConfigMaps, and Pod logs. Below is a minimal set of required permissions:


    rules:

    # For creating/deleting code ConfigMaps and patching ownerReferences

    - apiGroups: [""] # Core API Group

    resources: ["configmaps"]

    verbs: ["create", "delete", "get", "patch"]

    user, one could specify following rubrics:


    Rubric 1: Agent''s response is direct and to the point.

    A combined score using individual rubric confidences will also be generated.

    Example: Lets take an example of a Weather Agent that has access to two tools:

    1: GeoCoding Tool: Coverts a city name, address or zip code into geographic

    coordinates.

    2: GetWeather Tool: Gets weather for the next 10 days for the given geographic

    coordinates.


    For this agent, one can create following Rubrics that could focus on tool use


    Rubric 1: A call is made to GeoCoding Tool.

    Rubric 2: A call is made to GetWeather Tool.

    Rubric 3: The call to GetWeather Tool happens after the GeoCoding Tool.

    Rubric 4: The input to GeoCoding Tool can be mapped back to user prompt.

    Rubric 5: The input to GetWeather Tool comes from the output of GeoCoding

    Tool.)


    For each rubric, this evaluator will generate a confidence score between 0

    and 1, where 0 means that agent''s response did not satisfy the rubric at all

    and 1 means complete adherence. Value closer to 1 are desirable.


    A combined score using individual rubric confidences will also be generated.

    Like individual rubric confidence scores, the range for this value will be

    between 0 and 1, and it will have the same interpretation.

    The PluginManager is an internal class that orchestrates the invocation of

    plugin callbacks at key points in the SDK''s execution lifecycle. It maintains

    a list of registered plugins and ensures they are called in the order they

    were registered.


    The core execution logic implements an "early exit" strategy: if any plugin

    callback returns a non-`None` value, the execution of subsequent plugins for

    that specific event is halted, and the returned value is propagated up the

    call stack. This allows plugins to short-circuit operations like agent runs,

    tool calls, or model requests.'

  docstring: "Provides self-healing, concurrent-safe error recovery for tool failures.\n\nThis plugin intercepts tool failures, provides structured guidance to the LLM\nfor reflection and correction, and retries the operation up to a configurable\nlimit.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n- **Concurrency Safe:** Uses locking to safely handle parallel tool\nexecutions\n- **Configurable Scope:** Tracks failures per-invocation (default) or globally\n  using the `TrackingScope` enum.\n- **Extensible Scoping:** The `_get_scope_key` method can be overridden to\n  implement custom tracking logic (e.g., per-user or per-session).\n- **Granular Tracking:** Failure counts are tracked per-tool within the\n  defined scope. A success with one tool resets its counter without affecting\n  others.\n- **Custom Error Extraction:** Supports detecting errors in normal tool\nresponses\nthat\n  don't throw exceptions, by overriding the `extract_error_from_result`\n  method.\n\n**Example:**\n```python\nfrom my_project.plugins\
    \ import ReflectAndRetryToolPlugin, TrackingScope\n\n# Example 1: (MOST COMMON USAGE):\n# Track failures only within the current agent invocation (default).\nerror_handling_plugin = ReflectAndRetryToolPlugin(max_retries=3)\n\n# Example 2:\n# Track failures globally across all turns and users.\nglobal_error_handling_plugin = ReflectAndRetryToolPlugin(max_retries=5,\nscope=TrackingScope.GLOBAL)\n\n# Example 3:\n# Retry on failures but do not throw exceptions.\nerror_handling_plugin =\n  ReflectAndRetryToolPlugin(max_retries=3,\n  throw_exception_if_retry_exceeded=False)\n\n# Example 4:\n# Track failures in successful tool responses that contain errors.\nclass CustomRetryPlugin(ReflectAndRetryToolPlugin):\n  async def extract_error_from_result(self, *, tool, tool_args,tool_context,\n  result):\n    # Detect error based on response content\n    if result.get('status') == 'error':\n        return result\n    return None  # No error detected\nerror_handling_plugin = CustomRetryPlugin(max_retries=5)\n\

For production\nuse, please use the standard run_async() method which provides full control\nover session management, event streaming, and error handling.\n\nArgs:\n    user_messages: Message(s) to send to the agent. Can be: - Single string:\n      \"What is 2+2?\" - List of strings: [\"Hello!\", \"What's my name?\"]\n    user_id: User identifier.
