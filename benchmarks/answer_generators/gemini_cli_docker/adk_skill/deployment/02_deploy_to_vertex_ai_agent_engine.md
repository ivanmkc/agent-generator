# Deploy to Vertex AI Agent Engine

[Agent Engine](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/overview)
is a fully managed Google Cloud service enabling developers to deploy, manage,
and scale AI agents in production. Agent Engine handles the infrastructure to
scale agents in production so you can focus on creating intelligent and
impactful applications.

## Install Vertex AI SDK

Agent Engine is part of the Vertex AI SDK for Python. For more information, you can review the [Agent Engine quickstart documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/quickstart).

### Install the Vertex AI SDK

```shell
pip install google-cloud-aiplatform[adk,agent_engines]
```

### Initialization

```py
import vertexai

PROJECT_ID = "your-project-id"
LOCATION = "us-central1"
STAGING_BUCKET = "gs://your-google-cloud-storage-bucket"

vertexai.init(
    project=PROJECT_ID,
    location=LOCATION,
    staging_bucket=STAGING_BUCKET,
)
```

For `LOCATION`, you can check out the list of [supported regions in Agent Engine](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/overview#supported-regions).

### Deploy your agent to Agent Engine

```python
from vertexai import agent_engines

remote_app = agent_engines.create(
    agent_engine=root_agent,
    requirements=[
        "google-cloud-aiplatform[adk,agent_engines]"   
    ]
)
```
