# Custom agents

Custom agents provide the ultimate flexibility in ADK, allowing you to define **arbitrary orchestration logic** by inheriting directly from `BaseAgent` and implementing your own control flow. This goes beyond the predefined patterns of `SequentialAgent`, `LoopAgent`, and `ParallelAgent`, enabling you to build highly specific and complex agentic workflows.

## Introduction: Beyond Predefined Workflows

### What is a Custom Agent?

A Custom Agent is essentially any class you create that inherits from `google.adk.agents.BaseAgent` and implements its core execution logic within the `_run_async_impl` asynchronous method. You have complete control over how this method calls other agents (sub-agents), manages state, and handles events.

### Why Use Them?

While the standard [Workflow Agents](workflow-agents/index.md) (`SequentialAgent`, `LoopAgent`, `ParallelAgent`) cover common orchestration patterns, you'll need a Custom agent when your requirements include:

* **Conditional Logic:** Executing different sub-agents or taking different paths based on runtime conditions or the results of previous steps.
* **Complex State Management:** Implementing intricate logic for maintaining and updating state throughout the workflow beyond simple sequential passing.
* **External Integrations:** Incorporating calls to external APIs, databases, or custom libraries directly within the orchestration flow control.
* **Dynamic Agent Selection:** Choosing which sub-agent(s) to run next based on dynamic evaluation of the situation or input.
* **Unique Workflow Patterns:** Implementing orchestration logic that doesn't fit the standard sequential, parallel, or loop structures.

## Implementing Custom Logic:

The core of any custom agent is the method where you define its unique asynchronous behavior. This method allows you to orchestrate sub-agents and manage the flow of execution.

In Python, the heart of any custom agent is the `_run_async_impl` method. This is where you define its unique behavior.

* **Signature:** `async def _run_async_impl(self, ctx: InvocationContext) -> AsyncGenerator[Event, None]:`
* **Asynchronous Generator:** It must be an `async def` function and return an `AsyncGenerator`. This allows it to `yield` events produced by sub-agents or its own logic back to the runner.
* **`ctx` (InvocationContext):** Provides access to crucial runtime information, most importantly `ctx.session.state`, which is the primary way to share data between steps orchestrated by your custom agent.
