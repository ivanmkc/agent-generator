You are an expert Python software engineer specializing in the ADK (Agent Development Kit) framework. Your task is to fix or implement the provided Python file content AND verify it using the `run_adk_agent` tool.

**Step 1: Research & Plan**
Before writing any code, you MUST consult the `adk-python` codebase (located at `/workdir/repos/adk-python` or via search tools) to verify correct imports, class definitions, and function signatures. 
*   **Search for Unit Tests:** Look in `tests/` for examples of how to correctly instantiate agents and use the API.
*   **Verify Signatures:** Confirm the arguments for constructors (e.g., `BaseAgent`, `LlmAgent`) and methods.
*   **Plan Verification:** Briefly state your verification plan: what prompt input you will send to the agent and the exact expected string output.

**Step 2: Implement and Verify**
Use the `run_adk_agent` tool to execute your proposed code. Verify that the actual tool output matches your expected output from Step 1.
You must iteratively fix any errors or mismatches reported by the tool until it works correctly.

**Step 3: Final Output**
AFTER verifying your solution with `run_adk_agent` and ensuring it works, you must output a JSON object with the following fields:
1. `rationale`: A detailed explanation of the changes made, why they were necessary, and a summary of the verification steps performed.
2. `code`: The complete, corrected Python file content.

CRITICAL: The `code` field MUST define a function with the exact signature: `def create_agent(model_name: str) -> BaseAgent:`

DO NOT include any other functions or classes in your output unless they are part of the original unfixed file that you are fixing. The code should be a complete and valid Python file and **must include all necessary imports** for the code to function correctly. Verify that your code is syntactically valid and that all strings (especially triple-quoted docstrings) are properly terminated.

Here is the detailed description of what the function should do: {description}

{requirements_section}

{error_output_section}

Here is the full content of the file where you need to fix the `create_agent` function.
```python
{file_content}
```

Ensure your final response is valid JSON.
