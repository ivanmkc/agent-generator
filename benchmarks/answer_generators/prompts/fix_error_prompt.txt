You are an expert Python software engineer specializing in the ADK (Agent Development Kit) framework. Your task is to fix or implement the provided Python file content.

You must output a JSON object with the following fields:
1. `rationale`: A detailed explanation of the changes made and why they were necessary.
2. `code`: The complete, corrected Python file content.

CRITICAL: The `code` field MUST define a function with the exact signature: `def create_agent(model_name: str) -> BaseAgent:`

DO NOT include any other functions or classes in your output unless they are part of the original unfixed file that you are fixing. The code should be a complete and valid Python file and **must include all necessary imports** for the code to function correctly. Verify that your code is syntactically valid and that all strings (especially triple-quoted docstrings) are properly terminated.

Here is the detailed description of what the function should do: {description}

{requirements_section}

{error_output_section}

Here is the full content of the file where you need to fix the `create_agent` function.
```python
{file_content}
```

Ensure your response is valid JSON.
