  question: What is the primary responsibility of the `AgentTool` class?
  options:
    A: Wrapping an agent, allowing it to be called as a tool within a larger application, using the agent's input and output schemas to define the tool's input parameters and process the tool's result.
    B: Simplifying the deployment of agents to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) by automatically generating the necessary YAML configuration files and managing the deployment process.
    C: Converting a natural language query into a structured API call, using the agent's defined schema to ensure the query is valid.
    D: Orchestrating the interaction between multiple agents, allowing them to communicate and share data seamlessly within a complex workflow, and managing their lifecycle.
  correct_answer: A
  explanation: The `AgentTool` class is designed to wrap an agent, enabling it to function as a tool within a broader application. It utilizes the agent's input schema to define the tool's input parameters and returns the agent's output as the tool's result. Options B, C, and D are plausible but incorrect; they describe functionalities outside the scope of the `AgentTool`'s primary responsibility. Specifically, option B refers to simplifying agent deployment on GKE, option C mentions converting natural language queries to API calls, and option D describes orchestrating interactions between multiple agents, none of which accurately reflect the core function of `AgentTool`.
