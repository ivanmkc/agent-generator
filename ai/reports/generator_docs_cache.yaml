      analyzed.**


      Since the input provided was **"None"**, I cannot perform an architectural analysis,
      determine the agent strategy (e.g., ReAct, Plan-and-Solve), identify tools,
      or evaluate memory management.


      Once you paste the code, I will provide a technical summary focusing on:

      1.  **Agent Strategy**

      2.  **Tool Usage**

      3.  **State Management**

      4.  **Special Architectural Features**'

  'GeminiCliPodman: gemini-cli:mcp_adk_agent_runner_ranked_knowledge':
    description: "**Architecture Summary:**\n\nThis configuration defines a **Containerized\
      \ RAG Agent** that orchestrates Google's Gemini model within a Podman container.\
      \ The architecture encapsulates the execution logic in a CLI-based runner (`GeminiCliPodmanAnswerGenerator`).\n\
      \n1.  **Agent Strategy:** The system utilizes a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation\
      \ (RAG)** loop. The `agent_runner` component implies an autonomous cycle (likely\
      \ ReAct or sequential retrieval) that queries an external knowledge base before\
      \ generating responses.\n2.  **Tools:** The primary tool is a **Vector Search**\
      \ engine, explicitly configured via `ADK_SEARCH_PROVIDER: vector`. The image\
      \ tag `mcp` suggests adherence to the **Model Context Protocol** for standardized\
      \ tool/data interfacing.\n3.  **Memory/State:** Context is managed via **Ranked\
      \ Retrieval**. The `ranked_knowledge` image tag indicates that retrieved vector\
      \ embeddings are not just appended but presumably re-ranked (e.g., via cross-encoders)\
      \ to prioritize relevance within the context window.\n4.  **Special Features:**\n\
      \    *   **Podman Isolation:** The agent operates in an isolated environment\
      \ (`gemini-cli`), ensuring dependency consistency and security.\n    *   **Re-ranking\
      \ Pipeline:** The specific image build (`ranked_knowledge`) points to a specialized\
      \ post-retrieval verification or sorting step to reduce hallucinations compared\
      \ to standard vector similarity."
