  docstring: 'Provides self-healing, concurrent-safe error recovery for tool failures. This plugin intercepts tool failures, provides structured guidance to the LLM for reflection and correction, and retries the operation up to a configurable limit. **Key Features:** - **Concurrency Safe:** Uses locking to safely handle parallel tool executions - **Configurable Scope:** Tracks failures per-invocation (default) or globally using the `TrackingScope` enum. - **Extensible Scoping:** The `_get_scope_key` method can be overridden to implement custom tracking logic (e.g., per-user or per-session). - **Granular Tracking:** Failure counts are tracked per-tool within the defined scope. A success with one tool resets its counter without affecting others. - **Custom Error Extraction:** Supports detecting errors in normal tool responses that don''t throw exceptions, by overriding the `extract_error_from_result` method. **Example:** ```python from my_project.plugins import ReflectAndRetryToolPlugin, TrackingScope
    # Example 1: (MOST COMMON USAGE): # Track failures only within the current agent invocation (default). error_handling_plugin = ReflectAndRetryToolPlugin(max_retries=3) # Example 2: # Track failures globally across all turns and users. global_error_handling_plugin = ReflectAndRetryToolPlugin(max_retries=5, scope=TrackingScope.GLOBAL) # Example 3: # Retry on failures but do not throw exceptions. error_handling_plugin = ReflectAndRetryToolPlugin(max_retries=3, throw_exception_if_retry_exceeded=False) # Example 4: # Track failures in successful tool responses that contain errors. class CustomRetryPlugin(ReflectAndRetryToolPlugin): async def extract_error_from_result(self, *, tool, tool_args,tool_context, result): # Detect error based on response content if result.get(''status'') == ''error'': return result return None  # No error detected error_handling_plugin = CustomRetryPlugin(max_retries=5) ```'

  docstring: 'Answers questions about structured data in BigQuery tables using natural language. This function takes a user''s question (which can include conversational history for context) and references to specific BigQuery tables, and sends them to a stateless conversational API. The API uses a GenAI agent to understand the question, generate and execute SQL queries and Python code, and formulate an answer. This function returns a detailed, sequential log of this entire process, which includes any generated SQL or Python code, the data retrieved, and the final text answer. The final answer is always in plain text, as the underlying API is instructed not to generate any charts, graphs, images, or other visualizations. Use this tool to perform data analysis, get insights, or answer complex questions about the contents of specific BigQuery tables. Args: project_id (str): The project that the inquiry is performed in. user_query_with_context (str): The user''s original request, enriched with
    relevant context from the conversation history. The user''s core intent should be preserved, but context should be added to resolve ambiguities in follow-up questions. table_references (List[Dict[str, str]]): A list of dictionaries, each specifying a BigQuery table to be used as context for the question. credentials (Credentials): The credentials to use for the request. settings (BigQueryToolConfig): The settings for the tool. Returns: A dictionary with two keys: - ''status'': A string indicating the final status (e.g., "SUCCESS"). - ''response'': A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a step in the API''s execution process (e.g., SQL generation, data retrieval, final answer).

  docstring: 'Base class for creating plugins. Plugins provide a structured way to intercept and modify agent, tool, and LLM behaviors at critical execution points in a callback manner. While agent callbacks apply to a particular agent, plugins applies globally to all agents added in the runner. Plugins are best used for adding custom behaviors like logging, monitoring, caching, or modifying requests and responses at key stages. A plugin can implement one or more methods of callbacks, but should not implement the same method of callback for multiple times. Relation with [Agent callbacks](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/callbacks/): **Execution Order** Similar to Agent callbacks, Plugins are executed in the order they are registered. However, Plugin and Agent Callbacks are executed sequentially, with Plugins takes precedence over agent callbacks. When the callback in a plugin returns a value, it will short circuit all remaining plugins and agent callbacks, causing all remaining plugins
    and agent callbacks to be skipped. **Change Propagation** Plugins and agent callbacks can both modify the value of the input parameters, including agent input, tool input, and LLM request/response, etc. They work in the exactly same way. The modifications will be visible and passed to the next callback in the chain. For example, if a plugin modifies the tool input with before_tool_callback, the modified tool input will be passed to the before_tool_callback of the next plugin, and further passed to the agent callbacks if not short circuited. To use a plugin, implement the desired callback methods and pass an instance of your custom plugin class to the ADK Runner.

    docstring: A plugin that saves files embedded in user messages as artifacts. This is useful to allow users to upload files in the chat experience and have those files available to the agent within the current session. We use Blob.display_name to determine the file name. By default, artifacts are session-scoped. For cross-session persistence, prefix the filename with "user:". Artifacts with the same name will be overwritten. A placeholder with the artifact name will be put in place of the embedded file in the user message so the model knows where to find the file. You may want to add load_artifacts tool to the agent, or load the artifacts in your own tool to use the files.

  docstring: 'ADK Service Registry. This module manages pluggable backend services for sessions, artifacts, and memory. ADK includes built-in support for common backends like SQLite, PostgreSQL, GCS, and Vertex AI Agent Engine. You can also extend ADK by registering custom services. There are two ways to register custom services: 1. YAML Configuration (Recommended for simple cases) If your custom service can be instantiated with `MyService(uri="...", **kwargs)`, you can register it without writing Python code by creating a `services.yaml` or `services.yml` file in your agent directory (e.g., `my_agent/services.yaml`). Example `services.yaml`: ```yaml services: - scheme: mysession type: session class: my_package.my_module.MyCustomSessionService - scheme: mymemory type: memory class: my_package.other_module.MyCustomMemoryService ``` 2. Python Registration (`services.py`) For more complex initialization logic, create a `services.py` file in your agent directory (e.g., `my_agent/services.py`).
    In this file, get the registry instance and register your custom factory functions. This file can be used for registration in addition to, or instead of, `services.yaml`. Example `services.py`: ```python from google.adk.cli.service_registry import get_service_registry from my_package.my_module import MyCustomSessionService def my_session_factory(uri: str, **kwargs): # custom logic return MyCustomSessionService(...) get_service_registry().register_session_service("mysession", my_session_factory) ``` Note: If both `services.yaml` (or `.yml`) and `services.py` are present in the same directory, services from **both** files will be loaded. YAML files are processed first, then `services.py`. If the same service scheme is defined in both, the definition in `services.py` will overwrite the one from YAML.'

    docstring: 'Provides self-healing, concurrent-safe error recovery for tool failures. This plugin intercepts tool failures, provides structured guidance to the LLM for reflection and correction, and retries the operation up to a configurable limit. **Key Features:** - **Concurrency Safe:** Uses locking to safely handle parallel tool executions - **Configurable Scope:** Tracks failures per-invocation (default) or globally using the `TrackingScope` enum. - **Extensible Scoping:** The `_get_scope_key` method can be overridden to implement custom tracking logic (e.g., per-user or per-session). - **Granular Tracking:** Failure counts are tracked per-tool within the defined scope. A success with one tool resets its counter without affecting others. - **Custom Error Extraction:** Supports detecting errors in normal tool responses that don''t throw exceptions, by overriding the `extract_error_from_result` method. **Example:** ```python from my_project.plugins import ReflectAndRetryToolPlugin,
      TrackingScope # Example 1: (MOST COMMON USAGE): # Track failures only within the current agent invocation (default). error_handling_plugin = ReflectAndRetryToolPlugin(max_retries=3) # Example 2: # Track failures globally across all turns and users. global_error_handling_plugin = ReflectAndRetryToolPlugin(max_retries=5, scope=TrackingScope.GLOBAL) # Example 3: # Retry on failures but do not throw exceptions. error_handling_plugin = ReflectAndRetryToolPlugin(max_retries=3, throw_exception_if_retry_exceeded=False) # Example 4: # Track failures in successful tool responses that contain errors. class CustomRetryPlugin(ReflectAndRetryToolPlugin): async def extract_error_from_result(self, *, tool, tool_args,tool_context, result): # Detect error based on response content if result.get(''status'') == ''error'': return result return None  # No error detected error_handling_plugin = CustomRetryPlugin(max_retries=5) ```'

    docstring: 'Answers questions about structured data in BigQuery tables using natural language. This function takes a user''s question (which can include conversational history for context) and references to specific BigQuery tables, and sends them to a stateless conversational API. The API uses a GenAI agent to understand the question, generate and execute SQL queries and Python code, and formulate an answer. This function returns a detailed, sequential log of this entire process, which includes any generated SQL or Python code, the data retrieved, and the final text answer. The final answer is always in plain text, as the underlying API is instructed not to generate any charts, graphs, images, or other visualizations. Use this tool to perform data analysis, get insights, or answer complex questions about the contents of specific BigQuery tables. Args: project_id (str): The project that the inquiry is performed in. user_query_with_context (str): The user''s original request, enriched
      with relevant context from the conversation history. The user''s core intent should be preserved, but context should be added to resolve ambiguities in follow-up questions. table_references (List[Dict[str, str]]): A list of dictionaries, each specifying a BigQuery table to be used as context for the question. credentials (Credentials): The credentials to use for the request. settings (BigQueryToolConfig): The settings for the tool. Returns: A dictionary with two keys: - ''status'': A string indicating the final status (e.g., "SUCCESS"). - ''response'': A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a step in the API''s execution process (e.g., SQL generation, data retrieval, final answer).
