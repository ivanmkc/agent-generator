# Benchmark Verification Log
Date: 2026-01-05

## Integration Tests
All integration tests passed successfully after refactoring `run_cli_command` and API key management.

- `test_adk_generator_output_structure`: **PASSED**
- `test_generator_execution`: **PASSED** (Local, Podman, and ADK Agents)
- `test_benchmark_orchestrator_integration`: **PASSED**
- `test_benchmark_orchestrator_sequential_execution`: **PASSED**

## Key Improvements
1. **Sticky API Keys:** Implemented `run_id` based key retrieval in `ApiKeyManager`.
2. **Context Safety:** Removed reliance on `contextvars` for key propagation in favor of explicit argument passing and environment injection (`extra_env`).
3. **Robust CLI Execution:** Updated `GeminiCli` generators to accept environment overrides, enabling correct key rotation in subprocesses.
4. **Agent Hallucination Fix:** Removed misleading instructions from `ImplementationPlanner` to prevent `write_file` hallucinations.

## Benchmark Run Status
The full benchmark run was initiated but timed out due to the extensive nature of the tests. Partial logs indicate successful execution of early test cases and correct key rotation behavior (e.g., `[ApiKeyManager] Key 8 short cooldown`). Some failures related to tool hallucinations (`run_code`) persists in specific complex cases and should be addressed in future agent tuning.
